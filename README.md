### Approach

##### First

- Came up with an idea of what I wanted to do. Created views for the website and planned out user stories.

##### Project week:
- Built the back end using Node.js with express and made sure it was functional before attempting anything else. Started to incorporate these calls into my HTML and css starting with login and registration first. Then began learning google maps API and how to incorporate it into my project.
Added custom markers and then messed around with handlebars to portray course descriptions in an organized manner.

### Reflecting
##### Hurdles
- Query limit with geocoder in google maps. Had to change back end to store lat and lng to reduce geocoding.
- solving comaptability issues with videos and google chrome.

##### Unsolved issues

Given more time, I would like to
- add reviews
- Ratings
- Sort courses by ratings
